title: "The Origin of Alfred 1: From Robot Dreamer to Robotics Engineer"
---

I started Alfred 1 because I wanted a robot that could mimic real-world problems—not just a toy, not just a remote-controlled car, but a stepping stone from “robot dreamer” to “actual robotics engineer.”

Alfred wasn’t just a random name I picked. It’s a mashup of the robots and characters that shaped my imagination growing up:

- **Alfred** — Batman’s butler  
- **5** — A nod to Johnny 5  
- **Butler aesthetic** — I always imagined him like a Minion in a butler outfit  
- **Voice** — Deep and slow like Lurch from *The Addams Family*

That’s the vision behind Alfred 5, the full-sized robotic butler I hope to build someday. A robot that can answer the door, bring a drink, maybe vacuum… the “dream build.”

But reality has limits:  
I’m one guy with a full-time job, a house remodel, and about ten side projects running through my brain at any given hour. If I jumped straight into the full-scale robot, I’d drown before I ever got a wheel turning.

So I made the smartest engineering decision possible:

**Start with Alfred 1. Learn. Build. Fail. Improve. Repeat.**

Alfred 1 uses a Raspberry Pi 5 with an SSD, a RPLidar A1M8, and smaller DC gear motors with encoders. Basically, all the core components of Alfred 5… but right-sized for a beginner who wants to actually finish a robot before he dies of old age.

And yes, the project’s physical state is pure chaos in my robotics lab.  
But in my mind?  
It’s systematically beautiful.
