            <h2>Launch Day: Why I Started AstroGear Labs</h2>
            <p><em>Posted: November 2025</em></p>

            <p>I started AstroGear Labs because I’ve spent my entire life wanting to create robots. Technology inspired me when I was younger, especially seeing all the sci-fi robots on screen. Imagine a world where robots interact with us on a daily basis. Today, that idea is real — robots exist in all walks of life.</p>

            <p>But I didn’t want to create robots for a billionaire’s playground. I wanted to build robots that make the world better. Not in the “world peace” sense — we all want that, but I’m afraid that’s still a fantasy. What I mean is robots that can save lives, help people, and work beside humans in a way that truly matters.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I’ve seen <em>Terminator</em>, and I know all about the Three Laws of Robotics. But that’s still science fiction. And even though we call today’s systems “AI,” the truth is that real artificial intelligence — the kind that could become Skynet — is still far in the future.</p>

            <p>I don’t know exactly where AstroGear Labs will go, but I do know it’s a place where my passion can keep growing. While robots are my main excitement, I’m also drawn to technology and innovative ways to improve daily life. Sure, phones may have pushed people backward socially, but not all technology is bad. And there will always be people who say we’re “defying God.” But are we? What if God <em>wants</em> us to grow, evolve, and use our minds to sustain our race?</p>

            <p>That’s a lot to take in, I know. But if you want to follow a <strong>real</strong> journey in robotics — with successes, failures, experiments, and lessons — then stick around for more.</p>

            <p>The next topic will be Alfred 1: my attempt at a mobile robot that can navigate its environment while I learn ROS 2 and everything else that comes with it.</p>

            <p><strong>May you find what fuels you for tomorrow.</strong><br>– ERT</p>

            <h2>The Origin of Alfred 1: From Robot Dreamer to Robotics Engineer</h2>
            <p><em>Posted: November 2025</em></p>

            <p>I started Alfred 1 because I wanted a robot that could mimic real-world problems — not just a toy, not just a remote-controlled car, but a stepping stone from “robot dreamer” to “actual robotics engineer.”</p>

            <p>Alfred wasn’t just a random name I picked. It’s a mashup of the robots and characters that shaped my imagination growing up:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alfred</strong> — Batman’s butler</li>
                <li><strong>5</strong> — A nod to Johnny 5</li>
                <li><strong>Butler aesthetic</strong> — imagined like a Minion in a butler outfit</li>
                <li><strong>Voice</strong> — deep and slow, like Lurch from <em>The Addams Family</em></li>
            </ul>

            <p>That’s the vision behind Alfred 5 — the future full-sized robotic butler I want to build someday. A robot that can answer the door, bring a drink, maybe vacuum…the “dream build.”</p>

            <p>But reality has limits: I’m one guy with a full-time job, a house remodel in progress, and ten side projects swirling through my brain at any given hour. If I jumped straight into the full-scale robot, I’d drown before I ever got a wheel turning.</p>

            <p>So I made the smartest engineering decision possible: <strong>Start with Alfred 1. Learn. Build. Fail. Improve. Repeat.</strong></p>

            <p>Alfred 1 uses a Raspberry Pi 5 with an SSD, a RPLidar A1M8, and small DC motors with encoders — all the core ingredients of Alfred 5, just in a digestible size that lets me actually finish a robot instead of staring at a lifelong dream.</p>

            <p>And yes, the project’s physical state is pure chaos in my robotics lab.<br>
            But in my mind? It’s systematically beautiful.</p>
